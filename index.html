      <h1>Functional Music to Improve</h1>
      <p>Focus in 15 minutes</p>
      <p>Our science-first approach creates music that sounds different-and affects the brain differently-than any other music.</p>

      <h2>Patented Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional music, including technology to elicit <strong>strong neural phase locking</strong>—allowing populations of neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity—and technology to remove distraction in sound
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer you into a desired mental state. In other words, we’ve found new ways to create music that helps you do what you need to do.

      <h2>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic institutions to run experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using fMRI and EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring performance on simple games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Our experiments always include a control condition (‘placebo’)</strong> of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference.
